# Golang Service Manager

Super basic service manager with a bit of dependency injection. Might be kind of 
usless in Go, but its still fun to mess with the pattern

## Testing

    go test -v ./...

## Run Example

    cd $GO_PATH/src/github.com/ebittleman.go-servicemanager
    go run example/example.go
